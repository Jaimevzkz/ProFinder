Profinder is an application developed for devices running the Android operating system. It aims to serve as an app that assists professionals from various fields in connecting with new clients, engaging in conversations with them, and building a reputation through client ratings upon completion of services. Simultaneously, clients will be rated by professionals. Users can utilize the map functionality to check which professionals are working in their area, thus streamlining waiting times. Both professionals and clients can be added to a favorites list for easy access if needed. Professionals and services will be categorized for better management and organization.

The application has been developed following the best possible practices, both in terms of code and architecture. Kotlin has been used as the programming language for the application (which is modern, safer, and more efficient than Java). Jetpack Compose toolkit has been used for the interfaces, designed to simplify UI development.
